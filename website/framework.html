					<p style="font-size: 18px">
					Since the initial release of Xournal in 2006, many changes, updates, and upgrades have happened to the underlying framework and libraries that Xournal relies on. The decision to upgrade the framework of a piece of software is a balance between software stability, active library support, effort, and functionality; for Xournal, upgrading was necessary to pave the way for future development.
					</p>
					<h1>GTK+3</h1>
					<p>
					The graphics framework used for Xournal is the GIMP Toolkit (or GTK+). It provides an API for creating graphical user interfaces with Windows, Dialogs, Widgets, and much more. Currently there are two major versions that are in use: GTK2 and GTK3. Although GTK2 is in use by a number of applications including Xournal, it is officially deprecated and its final release was in January 2011. The new version provides improved performance, new features (such as multi-touch functionality), reliability, and active developer support. Significant time was spent attempting converting Xournal to the latest version, however it was concluded that the amount of work required would be too costly at this point in time. This is because Xournal depends on a library known as libgnomecanvas, which is only available when using GTK+2 and has no official replacement in GTK+3. There exist some non-official replacements, however using them would be risky due to the current volatility of the GTK library.
					</p>
					<div style="clear: both"></div>
					<h1>GtkBuilder</h1>
					<p>
					Applications developed with the GTK+ graphics framework can be implemented in a several programming languages, including C and Python. For the C toolkit API bindings, UI elements can be created programmatically, or through a graphical GTK WYSIWYG designer, known as Glade. This designer allows for developers to quickly create a user interface with a drag-and-drop style interface, allowing for a reduced amount of code to write and a short time to release. The UI specification is saved in a Glade XML format. To create the user interface from this specification, Xournal was using C files generated from an old version of Glade. This was so old in fact, that we were not able to compile a version of Glade old enough to support this functionality. Instead, we upgraded Xournal to use the latest method of loading the XML file: GtkBuilder. This GTK class loads the XML specifications at runtime and hence allows for faster UI development time, since recompilation is not necessary.
					</p>
					<div style="clear: both"></div>
					<h1>Windows Installer</h1>
					<p>
					Xournal is an open-source note-taking software program, and thus the users of it come from multiple platforms including Linux and Windows. Because a lot of Windows users don't always build programs from source code, it is beneficial to the Windows community to create an installer for Windows that will automatically configure all the required Windows binary files and libraries and place them together in an appropriate directory. The binary executable for the Windows installer was created by compiling the Xournal source code using MinGW. This executable file was packaged with the required Xournal.glade file as well as the required libraries using a free software program for Windows called Advanced Installer.
